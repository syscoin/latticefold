/// An umbrella trait of a ring suitable to be used in the LatticeFold protocol.
///
/// The ring is assumed to be of the form $$\mathbb{Z}_p\[X\]/(f(X)),$$ for a polynomial
/// $f(X) \in \mathbb{Z}_p\[X\],\: d=\mathrm{deg}\ f(X)$, (typically, this is a cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_m(X)$) so it has
/// two isomorphic forms:
///   * <i>The coefficient form</i>, i.e. a ring element is represented as the unique polynomial $g$ of the
///     degree $\mathrm{deg}\ g < d$.
///   * <i>The NTT form</i>, i.e. a ring element is represented as its image along the Chinese-remainder isomorphism
///     $$\mathbb{Z}_p\[X\]/(f(X))\cong \prod\limits\_{i=1}^t\mathbb{Z}_p\[X\]/(f\_i(X)),$$
///     where $f\_1(X),\ldots, f\_t(X)$ are irreducible polynomials in $ \mathbb{Z}_p\[X\]$ such that
///     $$f(X) = f\_1(X)\cdot\ldots\cdot f\_t(X).$$
///
/// When $f(X)$ is a cyclotomic polynomial the factors $f\_1(X),\ldots, f\_t(X)$ have equal degrees, thus the fields in the RHS of
/// the Chinese-remainder isomorphism are all isomorphic to the same extension of the field $\mathbb{Z}\_p$, implying the NTT form
/// of the ring is a direct product of $t$ instances of $\mathbb{Z}\_{p^\tau}$ for $\tau=\frac{d}{t}$ with componentwise operations.
///
/// If `R: SuitableRing` then we assume that the type `R` represents the NTT form of the ring as the arithmetic operations
/// in the NTT form are much faster and we intend to use the NTT form as much as possible only occasionally turning to the
/// coefficient form (usually, when Ajtai security aspects are discussed). The associated type `CoefficientRepresentation` is the corresponding
/// coefficient form representation of the ring.
///
/// A type `R: SuitableRing` and its `R::CoefficientRepresentation` has to satisfy the following conditions:
///   * `R` has to be an `OverField` to exhibit an algebra over a field `R::BaseRing` structure.  
///   * `R::CoefficientRepresentation` has to be an algebra over the prime field `R::BaseRing::BasePrimeField` of the field `R::BaseRing`.
///   * `R::BaseRing::BasePrimeField` has to be absorbable by sponge hashes (`R::BaseRing::BasePrimeField: Absorb`).
///   * `R` and `R::CoefficientRepresentation` should be convertible into each other.
///   * `R::CoefficientRepresentation` is radix-$B$ decomposable and exhibits cyclotomic structure (`R::CoefficientRepresentation: Decompose + Cyclotomic`).
///
/// In addition to the data above a suitable ring has to provide Poseidon hash parameters for its base prime field (i.e. $\mathbb{Z}\_p$).
